# React Countdown Timer

## What am I?

- The React Countdown is an application that allows you to countdown to a custom event of your choosing.

## How Do I work?

- You enter your a title for your event, a specific date and time, and an optional description and the countdown will generate the exact time left until your event starts.
- It is also possible to enter your exact location so that time zones are taken into account.
